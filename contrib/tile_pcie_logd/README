Introduction
------------

This application allows writing files to an x86 host from a TILEncore-Gx
PCIe card.  The file name and data are sent over PCIe using the Tilera
Packet Queue API from an aplication running on the Tilera processor.

The original purpose is to write log files from Suricata (Intrusion
Dectection System) on the x86 host's file system.

Running The Logger
------------------

To run the application, set the TILERA_ROOT environment variable to
point to a valide Tilera MDE, then do:

   make run

The application should be started before the application on the Tile
side that will be generating the log data.

By default, queue number 0 is used. The --queue_index=N command line
argument can be used to change the queue number.

If more than one TILEncore-Gx PCIe card is installed, the --card=M
argument changes to listening to card M.

Caveats
-------

Due to the fact that the host driver allocates 4MB physically
contiguous memory for the packet queue ring buffer, it is possible
that this allocation could fail on a host whose memory has been
considerably fragmented. If the host program exits with the following
error, reboot the host and run the test again.

Host: Failed to open '/dev/tilegxpci%d/packet_queue/t2h/0': Cannot
allocate memory
